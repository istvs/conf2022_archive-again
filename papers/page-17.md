Title: Field Validation of Egress Process for Planetary Rover

Authors: Zhaolong Dang, Jirong Zhang, and Baichao Chen

Abstract: After the planetary spacecraft landed on the surface, the rovers carried on the spacecraft will be powered up and arrived to the planetary surface after complex self-testing procedures. In order to validation of these procedures, the test conditions should be built in the proving ground. The technical systems of field validation for egress process of planetary rover are shown in this paper. Firstly, the Chinese rover egress procedures are described. The typical procedures include several steps such as the unlocked the fixed mechanisms of the rover body, powered up the rover through the lander, unlocked the rover typical mechanism (mast, manipulator), communicated with the earth or relay orbiter, etc. After the rover performance were reviewed, the rover can be controlled and walked to the planetary surface. Secondly, the field validation systems are given including such as the low gravity system, the integrated testing system, the rover model with its assistant equipment, the simulated lander, etc. Thirdly, the conditions of field tests are described including the slope of terrain surface, the obstacle distribution, the position of simulated lander, etc. The test results of Chinese lunar and Martian rover were shown. Finally, the egress process of Chinese rovers on Moon and Mars are described. The technical systems of field validation wear built firstly for Chinese lunar rover Chang’e-3 Yutu and improved for Chinese Martian rover Zhurong. The technical systems work well and can be used for the development of planetary rover in the future.
